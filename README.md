- dashboard_complex: map of msa weighted dots (by rank), parameter controls for all 8 factors, live ranking of all msas based on current weights (uses Top Ten and V1_reranked_complex)
- dashboard_simple_v1: map of msa weighted dots (by rank), parameter controls for only three main categories, live ranking of all msas based on current weights (uses v1_reranked_simple and Top Ten)
  - DOES NOT use spacers to cover irrelevant parameters
  - uses weights sheet to display actual current weights -- recalculated automatically based on drop-down
- dashboard_simple: map of msa weighted dots (by rank), parameter controls for only three main categories, live ranking of all msas based on current weights (uses v1_reranked_simple and Top Ten)

### book_state_abbr
Workbook for map in book front inside cover
- bookmap: sheet with unweighted dots, greyscale, state abbreviations
  - state abbreviations done by adding coordinate locations for state labels to the data source, then duplicating longitude to create two identical maps, changing the filters and formatting on each so one shows MSA dots and the other shows state abbreviations, then selecting dual axis to merge onto one map
  - some state name coordinates adjusted to be off land, then annotation created with empty annotation box to connect to the state area
  - also blocks out Bahamas by creating empty annotation box
